# Why Plated

## The Lawn for Executivesâ€‹

### We started The Lawn Grill and Salad Cafe in Novembers 2011, introducing the concept of DIY grills on salad to Singapore. Over the years, we found out that some of our customers are busy executives who hardly have time to head out for their lunch. We thought we should make their life easier.

# We plan. We cook. You enjoy.

## Eating well shouldn't be complicated.

### Your day's already pretty full. Our chefs work hard to create delicious food with the right mix of fruits and veggies, and the protein and nutrients you need every day. We use the best ingredients to create dishes that are high on flavor, and low on butter, oils and sugar.

# Who should order from Plated

## Everyone. Really.

### The food looks good and tastes even better. Plated is ideal for those who are hosting lunch meetings, tasked to cater for the whole company or even just ordering for a small group. The food comes neatly packed in a bento box with clear labels for your guests. With food that tastes like fireworks in your mouth and dressed in style, you don't need a reason to order from us.
